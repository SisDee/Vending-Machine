# Vending-Machine

This is Web application implemetation of a vending machine which vends products based upon four (4) denominations of coins and returns coins if there is no item.
The Web application is required to perform the foollowing functionalities:
•When the application loads, it loads data about all the instances from the products and Coins and visualizes this data in some way. (e.g. A table with all the data)
•The application must have some mechanism for refreshing all the data from the API without having to reload the entire application (e.g. A refresh data button)
•The application must have some mechanism for refreshing the data of only a section (products or coins)
•The application should show the user some indication that it is refreshing/loading new data.

Functional Requirements:

1. The database should have a functional audit trail and be represented in a form of a table.
2. The screen should be able to show print on-screen data of the coins and products rendered by the vending machine.
3. The screen should have the functionality mechanism that allows the data to be updated constantly when required.
4. It should be as ingle page application.


Non-Functional Requirements:

1. The interface of the Web Application should be easy to navigate through.
2. The outputs should be mathematically reliable .
3. Shows a great amount of data integrity and usability.


Software Framework Description :
AngularJS
AngularJS is a structural framework for dynamic web apps. It lets you use HTML as your template language and lets you extend HTML's syntax to express your application's components clearly and succinctly. AngularJS's data binding and dependency injection eliminate much of the code you would otherwise have to write.
It's easier to work with and has interface tenplates availabe to help save on time on the front-end coding.

Programming languages used:
Javascript
Python

High-Level Architectural Descriptions
UML Diagrams

Description of viewpoints:
1. Development View
Component Diagram:

The figure below is a component diagram. It shows the system’s physical structure and pays attention to the system’s components and how they relate.

2. Logical View
State Diagram:

State Machine Diagrams demonstrate the business rules for the absolute changes in states, inherent in the attributes of the objects. They are useful for modeling potential states of objects, as well as transitioning between states.

Class Diagram:

The Domain Class Model Diagram shows the relationships, between the various classes and how they interact with one another. This would typically be useful to the designers of the database, interface designers, and analysts, who would be concerned with optimizing performance and such.

3.Physical View
Deployment Diagram:

A deployment diagram is a diagram that shows the relationship between run-time processing nodes and the components that live on them, in other words it is a kind of structure diagram that is used in modeling the physical aspects of an object-oriented system.

4. Process View
Activity Diagram:

An activity diagram shows the processes that a user will go through from beginning to end and how to system would respond given different actions during this process.

Sequence Diagram:

This System Sequence Diagram shows the dialogue (input and output) between the actors and the system, such as the exchange of messages or the flow of data. A System Sequence Diagram would typically be used by the interface design and the systems analysis teams.

5. Scenarios
Use Case Diagram:

Use case diagrams are used to show the relationships between use cases (actionable events), actors, and the system.
